<p>Every week, I (try to) send out an email newsletter -- mostly a collection of links to others' writing about education and technology. <a href="http://news.hackeducation.com/blog/index.html">This site provides an archive</a> (or at least links to online copies). You can subscribe to the newsletter <a href="http://tinyletter.com/audreywatters">here</a>.</p>
